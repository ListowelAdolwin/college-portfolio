                Aided in developing an Intelligent Wireless Sensor Network Based fire
                alarm system for gas deposits. The system helps to remotely monitor gas
                depots and know the exact situation in case of fire occurrence.

                Automatic and intelligent fire detection system is important for early detection and promptly
                extinguishing fire. Fire is a danger leads to quick destroying of assets and human lives. Moreover, it
                can propagate in fast manner according to several factors such as wind direction, fired contents (gas,
                fuel), etc. The fire is giant phenomena which can be controlled in its early stages but this period does
                not take except few seconds, there after it turns into a formidable force where to be difficult to
                control.

                With the scientific progress, man found himself before requirements that imposing obligation
                upon him to consider the velocity of fire discovery where the scientific progression has been exploited
                in the field of communications and information transfer towards developing means of fire alarm and
                linking these means with Automatic Firefighting System where the time element is one of the most
                important factors in the process of fighting and controlling the fire. The area of this research is
                limited
                to Kumasi GAS depots and briefly the problem concentrates in intelligent fire alarm and monitoring
                system because they have a problem to know where the fire location and sometimes the firefighting
                unit miss the location of fire, also they have not scientific scenarios for people and vehicles to exit
                by
                safest way, and one of the main reasons is the lack of firefighting resources, the research here applies
                the concept of resource sharing by enabling communication among the nearest firefighting units.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, enables them to remotely monitor the gas depots and knowing the exact situation in case of fire
                occurrence. In this research, we survey previous studies to make our contributions of sensor networks
                to early fire detection and find the safest way to exit when there is alarm detected and also short path
                for firefighting unit to reach fired area. The idea starts by sensing the signal coming from the sensors
                to define the fire location, direction and size. Then concentrate on how to reach the fire location and
                exit safe way for employee and people when there is a fire. The result of this research gives strong
                justification that prove and verify our methodology with a clear contribution in Improved Dijkstra
                algorithm for firefighting like Forced-Dijkstra and Geo-Dijkstra. Furthermore, an evaluation of the
                above-mentioned algorithms has been done showing very promising and realistic results.

                Helped design an optimized a W-Tailored Optical Fiber that checks the

                This research work studies the temperature effects in W-shaped core refractive index optical fiber.
                The work designs an optimized W-tailored optical fiber (OWTOF) that checks the effect of rising
                temperatures in W-tailored optical fiber (WTOF) for better communication. Initially, an introduction
                to the general concept of optical fibers including tailored optical fibers (TOF), temperature effects
                and
                models is presented as a background. This is followed by studies on existing literature on optical
                fibers where a gap is identified.
            </p>
            <p>

                The gap is that; temperature rise in communication fibers is
                challenging the use of tailored fibers through unnecessary distortion and delay in information. Also,
                fiber design is limited in scope because of existing design practice. Thus, the need to optimize fibers
                for better communication. To fill in this gap, a three-stage optimization process is designed and a
                methodology for achieving this optimization for the benefit of telecommunication systems and
                services is presented. Here, a regularly varying function is introduced in the geometry of WTOF for
                the temperature parameter leading to the design of the OWTOF. Finally, analytical and numerical
                simulations covering the performance of the OWTOF in relation to WTOF are stated and proven.
                Additionally, six research questions and remarks are answered. A major result of this work shows that
                the OWTOF is a better fiber for controlling temperature rises than the WTOF at a propagation
                distance around one unit. Hence, better suited for communication without distortion and delaycompared to
                WTOF in this region. Finally, the research work concludes with three recommendations
                for improving this work for better communication.
