                Automatic and intelligent fire detection system is important for early detection and promptly
                extinguishing fire. Fire is a danger leads to quick destroying of assets and human lives. Moreover, it
                can propagate in fast manner according to several factors such as wind direction, fired contents (gas,
                fuel), etc. The fire is giant phenomena which can be controlled in its early stages but this period does
                not take except few seconds, there after it turns into a formidable force where to be difficult to
                control. With the scientific progress, man found himself before requirements that imposing obligation
                upon him to consider the velocity of fire discovery where the scientific progression has been exploited
                in the field of communications and information transfer towards developing means of fire alarm and
                linking these means with Automatic Firefighting System where the time element is one of the most
                important factors in the process of fighting and controlling the fire.

                The area of this research is limited
                to Kumasi GAS depots and briefly the problem concentrates in intelligent fire alarm and monitoring
                system because they have a problem to know where the fire location and sometimes the firefighting
                unit miss the location of fire, also they have not scientific scenarios for people and vehicles to exit
                by
                safest way, and one of the main reasons is the lack of firefighting resources, the research here applies
                the concept of resource sharing by enabling communication among the nearest firefighting units.
                Thus, enables them to remotely monitor the gas depots and knowing the exact situation in case of fire
                occurrence.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this research, we survey previous studies to make our contributions of sensor networks
                to early fire detection and find the safest way to exit when there is alarm detected and also short path
                for firefighting unit to reach fired area. The idea starts by sensing the signal coming from the sensors
                to define the fire location, direction and size. Then concentrate on how to reach the fire location and
                exit safe way for employee and people when there is a fire. The result of this research gives strong
                justification that prove and verify our methodology with a clear contribution in Improved Dijkstra
                algorithm for firefighting like Forced-Dijkstra and Geo-Dijkstra. Furthermore, an evaluation of the
                above-mentioned algorithms has been done showing very promising and realistic results.
