                Attendance is typically a list of people present at a particular event. Manual approach of attendance
                taking has not been very effective due to difficulty in keeping the attendance list over a long period of
                time, unnecessary time wastage during writing or signing, improper documentation, students
                forgetting to write or sign-the attendance paper among others.
        </p>

            <p> The aim of this project is to develop a
                technology assisted attendance system that will enhance efficient and effective means of taking
                attendance using fingerprint. Fingerprint was used as the unique physiological trait of an individual.
                This attendance system involved data acquisition of fingerprint samples of 44 students of the Garden
                City Special School. Image pre-processing techniques which include image Gray scale conversion,
                binarization, central line thinning of binarized image, dilation of thinned image and thinning of dilated
                image were carried out on the acquired data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The features of the pre-processed data were extracted
            using minutiae matching and classification of the extracted features was done using Euclidean
                distance. Evaluation was done using False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and
                Accuracy. The attendance system was developed using MATLAB R2015a. Experiment was
                conducted with 168 sample images (both left and right thumb fingerprint) selected to train the system
                and 96 sample images (both left and right thumb fingerprint) to test the system's functionality. The
                system has a False Accept Rate of 0.83, False Reject Rate of0.01.
        </p>

        <p>
            It has an accuracy of 87% with
            average execution time of 4.81 secs. This project has developed a software prototype of a fingerprint-
            based attendance system. The system was implemented as a hardware prototype that uses real - time
            fingerprints from individuals during recognition as opposed to the currently implemented software
            prototype which uses offline images acquired earlier.
