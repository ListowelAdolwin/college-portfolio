                In recent years, there have been rise in the number of applications based on Radio Frequency
                Identification (RFID) systems and have been successfully applied to different areas such as
                transportation, health, education, hospitality industry and many others. RFID technology facilitates
                automatic wireless identification using electronic passive and active tags with suitable readers. In
                this
                project, I dealt with solving the problem of theft in our inhabitants by locking the gate and the door
                using RFID technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application of RFID as two-way authentication was designed to help
                people to access their gate and the door of a certain compound being identified before entering the
                compound to reduce on the theft in our environment and to know who enters the compound. The
                system will use a Raspberry Pi technology to allow it perform these tasks of identification well. In
                this
                system, once the person reaches the gate of the compound, the person has to identify him/herself by
                putting the tag card in front of the tag reader, this one, once identified will process the data to the
                Raspberry Pi and it’s to the Raspberry Pi to check the given data on the tag to confirm the
                person’sentrance and therefore the gate opens by the servo motors rotating a certain angel, then after
                this has
                happened, the gate can be opened and the person may access the gate and enter the compound, once
                the car has passed, the proximity sensors detects the presence of the car and after a specific amount of
                second, it closes the gate by reactivating the servo motors again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly at the door point, when the
                person reaches the door he or she has entered the password and the keypad sends the code to the
                raspberry pi and it’s the one to confirm the code whether it’s to be accepted or to be ejected, and once
                it is allowed, the signal is sent to the servo motors controlling the door and therefore the door opens
                and the person may access the door and enters the house, once inside can go out by using the push
                button then the servo motor opens the door automatically and the person may access the door and exit
                the house, this is the same when you enter the house and wishes to lock the door again, all that you
                have to do is press the push button, and it closes automatically by activating the servo motors.
